Satellite Jobs 

Now that you can actually launch satellite jobs on itself, it's now  possible to create maintenance jobs, launch them  and schedule them using the recurring logic engine in the satellite server. 

In order to run these jobs, you need to  set the system in your Search Query to run it on your satellite server. You may have to set your Organization to "Any Organization" and your location to "Any Location" for it to show up.
